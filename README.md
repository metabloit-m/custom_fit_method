# Writing your own training and evaluation Loops
This example shows you how to re-implement the fit() method from scratch.This is very helpful especially if you are doing other forms of machine learning apart from supervised learning. In forms such as generative learning, self-supervised learning and reinforcemnt learning will require you to implement your own training and evaluation loops. The fit() method would not help since it is solely focused on supervised learning(input and targets data are both provided).
